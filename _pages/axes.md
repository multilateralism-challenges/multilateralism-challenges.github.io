Key questions are: What are the major topics addressed in multilateral arenas? How do states navigate through decision-making mechanisms? What is the capacity of multilateralism to deliver? These questions will be explored mainly for formal multilateral institutions such as the UN and regional blocs. The project seeks to innovate through three axes: 

* 1) temporal: we inspect the historic acquis of organizations such as the UN, from foundation to present, to map themes and outcomes; 
* 2) in-depth and thematic: specific debates, such as environment, democracy, and peacekeeping, are analyzed in detail; 
* 3) methodological diversity: we combine cutting-edge quantitative and qualitative methods.
